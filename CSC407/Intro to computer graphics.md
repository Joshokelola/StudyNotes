# What is computer graphics?
This simply refers to any **pictorial representation** created or manipulated **using computers**, It includes sketches, drawings and visual materials that convey information through **digital picture** elements called **pixels**. These graphics can range from simple 2D drawings to complex 3D renderings.

**What is a pixel?**
A pixel is the smallest addressable screen element, it is the smallest piece of the display screen we can control.

# What are the differences between Manual drafting and Computer Graphics?
- Manual drafting is **considerably faster** because the tools are readily available **unlike computer graphics** which takes a considerable amount of load time such as for writing the program, debugging it.

- Correction in manual drafting **takes more time** and usually the result looks rough, many at times you'd need a fresh paper. With computer graphics, corrections are **faster** and the result will look more original.

- **Special effects** like colour and shading **take more time/effort** in manual drafting and requires **specialists**. With computer graphics, these enhancements are **built into the software/hardware** which results in **lesser time and lesser effort**.

- If there's a **change in view** usually caused by changing the viewpoint, scale e.t.c the entire thing **will have to be redrawn** as a fresh drawing. However when **computerised**, all modifications can be done through **a few commands without any stress**.

- **Manual drafting** requires **relatively low investment** compared to the **enormous amount** required for **computer graphics**.

# What Are Some Advantages of computer graphics?
- It provides tools for producing pictures of not only real word objects but also of abstract, synthetic objects such as mathematical surface in 4D.
- It has the ability to show animations(moving pictures).
- Computer graphics provides a tool called **motion dynamics**. Using this tool the user can move and tumble objects with respect to a stationary observer.
- Computer graphics also provides a tool called **update dynamics**, this tool makes it possible to change the shape, colour or other properties of an object.
- Computer graphics can provide audio feedback alongside graphical feedback to make a simulated environment feel more realistic.

# Classification Of Computer Graphics 
**ACCORDING TO APPLICATION**:
- **Passive computer graphics(Off-line)**: an example of this is static website, the user has no control of over the contents displayed on the computer.
- **Interactive computer graphics (On-line)**: displays are typically controlled by mouse, trackball, joystick etc. This is referred to as interactive because the user can interact with the machine as per his requirements. Examples include video games, cartoons, special effects in movies.

**OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS**:
- **Business graphics/Presentation graphics**: this refers to graphics such as bar-charts, pie charts etc. used to present quantitative information to inform and convince the audience.
- **Scientific graphics**: this includes things like x-y plots, curve fitting
