## What is User Interface design?
This is the design of websites, computers, e.t.c look and feel with a focus on user's experience and interaction. The main goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible so that the users can achieve their goals easily.

## Principles of Interface Design
In the past, users had to adapt to the software that was developed, this shouldn't be the case instead ***the software/system should adapt to the user***.
Here are some general principles to adhere to for good user design:

1st rule
**Access** - a good system is usable without help or instruction by a user having knowledge and experience in the use of applications generally but no experience with the specific system/application.

2nd rule
**Efficacy** - good systems don't interfere with or disturb the efficient use by a skilled user having reasonable experience with the system.

3rd rule
**Progression** - good systems are forward thinking and incorporate new features as the user gains experience with the system

4th rule
**Support** - good systems support the work that users are trying to accomplish, making it easier, simpler, faster or more fun.

5th rule
**Context** - good systems are adapted to the conditions and environment of the operational context within which they're deployed.
