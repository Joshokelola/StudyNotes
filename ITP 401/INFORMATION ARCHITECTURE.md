# What is information architecture?
This focuses on organising, structuring and labelling content in an effective and sustainable way. The end goal is to help users find information and complete tasks easily and efficiently.

## Why does well thought out IA matter?
The major purpose of the IA is to help users understand where they are, what they've found, what's around, and what to expect.
Creating these type of systems of information, you need to understand how users, content and context are related.
**Rosenfield and Morville** referred to this as the "**Information ecology**" and visualised this as a venn diagram.
