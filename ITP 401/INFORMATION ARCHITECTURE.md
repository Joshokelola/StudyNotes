# What is information architecture?
This focuses on organising, structuring and labelling content in an effective and sustainable way. The end goal is to help users find information and complete tasks easily and efficiently.

## Why does well thought out IA matter?
The major purpose of the IA is to help users understand where they are, what they've found, what's around, and what to expect.
Creating these type of systems of information, you need to understand how users, content and context are related.
**Rosenfield and Morville** referred to this as the "**Information ecology**" and visualised this as a venn diagram.

**INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE** involves the following steps:
- assessing existing and needed content,
- organising the pages,
- providing clues to help use the site efficiently, and
- developing navigational structure.

**What you need to create a good information architecture -**
- **People**: understanding what they need to do, how they think and what they already know
- **Content**: what you have, what you should have and what you need.
- **Context**: the business or personal goals for the site, who else will be involved and what your constraints are.

**What happens when you don't have a good understanding of the three factors listed above?**
- A **LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PEOPLE** will result in grouping content in ways that don't make any sense to them or in a way that further complicates things.
- A **LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CONTENT** will lead to IA that doesn't work well for current and future content.
- A **LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CONTEXT** will lead to the inability to create something that works for people and the business
