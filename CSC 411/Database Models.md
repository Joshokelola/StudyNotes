## Types Of Database Models

- <u><b>Hierarchical Database Model:</b></u> this is when the data is organised into a **tree like structure**. The data are stored as records which are connected to each other through links in a one-to-one relationship. The data is connected in such a way that the records have **a single root**. Relationships among the records are determined at the runtime of the database transaction.

- **Network Database Model:** this is basically an improvement on the hierarchical database model. It organises data in a tree-like structure too but in a flexible way so as to accommodate many-to-many relationship.

- **Relational Database Model:** this is when data is organised with the help of tables. It exemplifies the separation of data into logical structures, data tables, views and indexes. Relationships between records are achieved using the foreign key.
	
	**Features of relational DB model**
	- Tables are arranged in form of records and the records are in turn arranged in form of attributes.
	- Records are differentiated by a so called **primary key**, the primary key ensures uniqueness of each of the records.
	- It has the concept of **foreign keys** which helps to initiate a logical connection between one relation and another.
	- **Secondary key** is an attribute of a relation that serves as indexes to a cluster of related records. It enables a cluster of records to be pulled out by just one command instead of continually retrieving records one after the other.
